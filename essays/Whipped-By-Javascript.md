## First Words

Javascript is a programming language commonly used to make websites interactive. I feel that Javascript is amazing so far as it adds functionality to the basic HTML and CSS. While HTML is used to display the page’s contents and CSS is used to determine how the page will look, Javascript is used to bring user interaction with things like drop-down menus, buttons, etc. From my perspective, I feel that javascript can have its pros and cons. However, It is amazing to know that these types of programming languages are commonly used to create websites we use today.

## Experiences and Thoughts

Having a bit of prior knowledge of javascript from high school and the internship I am currently in, I felt that I have been able to learn new things from this module. Most of the syntax and style of coding are similar to other programming languages like C. An example of this would be using Escape Sequences in string. Although I know some of the basic ones like “\n” and “\t”, there were still other escape sequences I did not know about. 

I feel that this style of learning is enjoyable as it combines something I like doing with something fun. It feels interesting to learn in an environment like this as you would think that coding is normally an office job where you will be coding in a cubicle. I believe that this form of learning would work for me as it has a factor of fun rather than dull boring text of code. As for the WODs, I find them to be useful, yet stressful at the same time. 
<img class="ui medium right floated image" src="../images/stressed.png"> Sometimes I find myself to be a slow coder as I would sometimes stare at the problem trying to figure out how to solve it. WODs are a great practice of your coding skill as well as your problem solving skills. However, if I am not prepared, it can be a struggle trying to work through future WODs. Having these forces us to prepare and practice beforehand so that we are vigilant and sharp when problem solving.

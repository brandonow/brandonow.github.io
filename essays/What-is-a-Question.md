## My Thoughts

Having smart questions are important for all careers including all of engineering. This is important especially for engineering as there are specific and complex information revolving around our career and what we do. Additionally, the world is slowly evolving everyday meaning that our grasp of all of this information will slowly become more harder and complex for us to understand. Asking smart questions are important as it would be difficult and time consuming for us to search through documents and such rather than asking the people around us or online for help. Being able to ask people can be more efficient as we can rely on people with experience to build upon and teach us.

Having the ability to ask effective and smart questions can strengthen and develop our ability to be a more efficient and experienced engineer. Every time we ask a smart question, we slowly develop our knowledge and our ability to work better. I feel that asking questions is always better than being stuck on something for hours. Without questions, we do not progress in our careers and our future as we are stuck or hindered by a problem. It is important to always ask questions, especially smart ones as it gives us the understanding we need to know about our constant changing world.

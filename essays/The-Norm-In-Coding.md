## Foundations of the Basics  

Just like learning and being able to apply a language like English, coding is exactly the same. Everyone expresses themselves differently whether it is speaking or writing. Likewise, coding is same where everyone has their own personal styles of writing it. Although everyone has their own style of doing things, standards come in when things start becoming formal. Writing formal essays or presenting formally typically has standards including indentations, proper diction, and transitions. Similarly to coding, there are certain standards that are used to format our code to be more templatable, universal, and easier to understand by others. Following a certain standard allows viewers to read things consistently. Applying this to coding can make it easier for everyone to understand consistently. 

In English, writing formal essays usually follows a certain standard and or template. For example, when writing a formal essay, rather than generally talking about the topic, there is usually certain sections like an introduction and a conclusion. Being able to follow a coding standard similarly to the essays can help provide a foundation for us to code better in the our futures. Learning coding standards is the same as learning how to use a template or taking notes. While coding normally, a person tends to learn coding standards and incorparate that into their everyday code. By doing so, people can easily understand each other's codes. This is helpful as coding can sometimes require people to work in groups and being able to understand each other's code can make it easier for people to work faster.    

## The ESLint Experience

After installing IntelliJ and ESLint, it was interesting IDE to use. Previously, I had only use services like wiliki and Visual Code to work on my code. However, I was able to use and learn IntelliJ for a little bit during my summer internship. I felt that it was nice to do multiple things as well as have certain functionalities we could use. I believe that having the green checkmark can be both useful and painful. <img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="/images/eslint-error.png"> Althought it can be a pain to get rid of the errors, I believe that having ESLint is a good checker as it checks for standards in code as well as errors you may get and why. As the semester goes on, it will be easier for me to use and IDE like IntelliJ with ESLint.

## First Thoughts

When I was in high school, I was still deciding on which major I wanted to become. I had a couple of majors in mind like architecture or engineering. I was partially scared to go into engineering as I heard it was a super hard and time consuming major. I had thought I lacked the ability and the smarts to become an engineer as I was not always the brightest or studious student. Although I was intimidated by the stories of engineering, that pushed me forward to step out of my comfort zone and try. <img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="/images/computer-engineering.jpg"> It wasn't until I took STEM in my junior and senior year that I knew that I wanted to work with technology. Another big part of my inspiration for becoming an engineer was my brother as he was someone I always looked up to. Luckily, our STEM class taught coding and a bit of hardware. During my first year in STEM, I learned how to code with basic HTML and CSS. We were able to learn the basics of HTML and CSS which lead us to create a webpage project locally on a computer. In our second year, I was able to create different and cool functionalities like a small shop or games using Javascript. Doing this was a lot of fun as I got to work on projects with friends and learned how technology works. 

When I enrolled into the University of Hawaii, I had determined my major to be computer engineering as I was accepted into the college of engineering. I decided to challenge myself to step out of my comfort zone and become something I wanted to be. Although I did not know what type of computer engineering I wanted to be, I knew I wanted to either do something with software development or work with hardware. I feel that technology is constantly changing as it slowly evolves and becomes better as the years goes on. However, with my interest in computer engineering, I understand that I have to build a strong foundation and understanding on concepts and multiple languages. 

## My Future

I am currently in my senior year of computer engineering. I have experienced and learned a lot from school, projects, and internships. I have learned to collaborate with others as well as work in unexpected situations like disagreements. I hope to improve my problem solving skills as well as refine my coding skills to be better with my future career. I also hope to meet new people that I can become friends with and learn new things from. Additionally, I hope to gain a career here for experience as well as a career somewhere else later on. I want to be able to experience coding in different states and places. I will be happy if I am able to take things I have learned from school and apply it to my future career and projects.

## Summer/Current Internship

During this summer, I was able to land an internship programm at the company eWorld Enterprise Solution where I learned what it is like to have a coding job. During this time, I was able to learn a lot from the other workers/mentors as well as refine my coding skills. <img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="/images/eworld-picture.jpg"> Although I only went into the office once during the internship as COVID was taking place, I learned a lot about front-end code as well as back-end code. This has been such an experience as I learned to communicate with people I have never met as well as learn a new type of programming language like Vue JS and ES6. 

For my project, our team is currently working on developing a web program that functions like Microsoft Access. Our team has to create a website that takes data from a database and output it on a front-end webpage. Coding this can be scary as I do not possess the knowledge to code these types of things. Additionally, I felt scared in my coding abilities and messing up which would result in slowing down my team and making them mad. However, despite all of the fear I have, I have learned and come to realize that there is nothing scared to be about as everyone starts somewhere. Additionally, I learned to not be afraid of asking questions or making mistakes as everything I do will be a learning process for me to improve upon.

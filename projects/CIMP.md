## CIMP Project

During my junior year in high school, I was offered an opportunity to be apart of the CIMP program. During my time on this project, I got to experience and learn a lot about coding and what it was like to work on a team of other developers. <img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="/images/cimp-picture.PNG"> This was a different environment for me as I only previously worked with one other person on a simple coding project. Our project had to do with the creation of a website which would have the main functionality of calculating storm water utility fee as well as other cool functionalities. 

During my time in this project, I only coded projects that were meant for classes. Doing the CIMP Project was an experience as I was put into a situation where I had to work together with other developers. I have learned to deal with unexpected situations as well as disagreements throughout the project. Additionally, the mentors were great help in giving advice and teaching us how to work together as well as refine our coding. I learned a lot about front end coding as well as some back end coding. Additionally, I learned how to use javascript to create a website as well as create cool functionalities. During this project, I was able to improve my coding and learn better habits that I will use in the future.

## Swimming

Swimming has been a big part of my life since a young age. I first learned how to swim when I was about 3 or 4 years old from YWCA. When I was about 6 or 7 years old, I joined Manoa Aquatics Swimming Club. I was able to find and join Manoa Aquatics because of my older brother and older cousins. <img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="/images/swimming.jpg"> Every swim practice was an hour and a half, 5 days a week. Much like coding, swimming and sports require practice to improve. In order to improve your coding, you have to good practicing habits. Likewise, if you want to improve time, get faster, you have to practice daily. It is good to have good practicing habits and practice the same amount of time and effort. 

During my time on Manoa Aquatics, I only knew the basics of all four strokes. I had to practice and keep up with older members to get better. As I grew older, I progressed through different coaches that helped improve and refine my techniques and times. Throughout the years, I have been able to improve and become faster through hard work and practice. Eventually, I joined swimming in highschool in addition to club swimming. Everything in high school swimming was more intense as it was more competitive with fast people. Additionally, the practices were longer and the sets were harder. I had to put more effort into practice to become faster and better. When I became a senior, I saw the fastest I could swim. During my senior year, I was able to qualify and swim in states for 2 individual events and 2 relay events. Being able to test my limits and find my potential is something that can be done in any situation including coding.
